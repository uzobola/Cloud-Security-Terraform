## Cloud Infrastructure Security Consultant for Microblog

### Project Overview
**Scenario:** You’ve been hired by Microblog, a fast-growing social media startup, to secure its cloud infrastructure. Microblog has recently deployed its application on AWS, and their CTO is concerned about potential vulnerabilities that could leave the company at risk for data breaches. Recently, there have been reports of suspicious activity, unusual system behavior, and… something about suspicious characters… or was it users? Either way, your role is to conduct a thorough infrastructure security review, identify critical vulnerabilities, and implement security measures to strengthen their cloud environment.

### Project Objectives
- **Security Assessment:** Identify and analyze potential vulnerabilities within Microblog's cloud infrastructure.
- **Mitigation and Hardening:** Implement measures to address at least **three** vulnerabilities, demonstrating an understanding of best practices in cloud security.
- **Documentation and Recommendations:** Document your findings and outline additional vulnerabilities you identified, along with recommendations on how to address them.

### Instructions

- **Setup:** This project includes a `main.tf` Terraform file to provision the infrastructure and a `blog.sh` script that is referenced in the Terraform configuration. To deploy, run: `terraform apply`. This will create the initial infrastructure as specified in the Terraform configuration.

- **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Review the current cloud setup and identify areas where security could be improved. Consider aspects such as network security, access controls, and data handling.

- **Implement Fixes:** Select at least **three** vulnerabilities and implement fixes to mitigate them. Your choices should demonstrate an understanding of security best practices, with a focus on strengthening the infrastructure.

- **Document Additional Findings:** Beyond the **three** you addressed, document additional vulnerabilities or areas of concern you encountered. Provide recommendations on how to mitigate these remaining risks, including any future security measures you would suggest.

#### Create Diagrams:
- **Current State Diagram:** Use any diagramming tool (e.g., Draw.io) to map out the existing infrastructure, highlighting areas with known vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Deployment Diagram:** Design a second diagram to illustrate your proposed secure configuration. Show how your mitigations improve the infrastructure’s security posture.

#### Submit Your Security Review:
Compile your findings, diagrams, and recommendations in a report, following the structure provided in the deliverables section below.

### Documentation Deliverables

- **Security Review Report:** A detailed report that includes:
  - **Vulnerabilities Addressed:** Describe the **three** vulnerabilities you chose to fix, including details of the mitigation steps and best practices applied.
  - **Additional Vulnerabilities:** List any additional vulnerabilities discovered, with brief descriptions and recommendations for mitigation.
  - **Diagrams:** Include the Current State Diagram and Secure Deployment Diagram in your report.
  - **Implementation Documentation:** Detail the steps taken to address each vulnerability you mitigated, along with any code changes or AWS configurations made.
  - **Executive Summary:** A concise overview of your security review, highlighting the main findings and recommendations for Microblog's executive team.
